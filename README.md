Purpose: 3rd year university submission for Game and Media Creation Processes module

Description: A group (of three) Unity2D project aimed developing and using a main mechanic to be the focus on a long sequence of level . In this project, we went with the matching mechanic, popularly found in mobile games. My contributions were towards the game design and proramming, as well as leading the group.

Disclaimer: This is a copy of the project, as the original was hosted under my university's platform. Specific proofs of contribution are validated by examiners of the university who have reviewed my contribution metrics with GitLab as well as seeing my frequent blog entries which document my contribution as well. I have been graded accordingly with an A.
## Cloning
Once cloned and with the project loaded, ensure that the aspect ratio mimics that of a mobile phone display. For instance, the default mode will be at 16:9, where it would be required to test the game in a 9:16 ratio. This ensures the UI will be displayed as intended, since this is a release targeted to be a mobile release.
