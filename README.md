Purpose: 3rd year university submission for Game and Media Creation Processes module

Description: A group (of three) Unity2D project aimed developing and using a main mechanic to be the focus on a long sequence of level . In this project, we went with the matching mechanic, popularly found in mobile games. My contributions were towards the game design and proramming, as well as leading the group.
## Cloning
Once cloned and with the project loaded, ensure that the aspect ratio mimics that of a mobile phone display. For instance, the default mode will be at 16:9, where it would be required to test the game in a 9:16 ratio. This ensures the UI will be displayed as intended, since this is a release targeted to be a mobile release.
